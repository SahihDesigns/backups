# Learn - How to Communicate

### **Communication and How to Communicate Better**

#### **Step 1: Simplify Your Words**

* Focus on one message at a time — confusion dissolves trust.
* Avoid “smart speak.” Customers don’t need to feel like they’re back in school; they need clarity.

#### **Step 2: Use Storytelling to Persuade**

* **Sutherland Style:** Show don’t tell. Share a quick story or example that illustrates how your product/service made a difference.

#### **Step 3: Practical Tips for Talking to Customers**

* **The Gary Vee 80/20 Rule:** Listen 80% of the time, talk 20%. Let your customers feel heard.
* **Dean Jackson Insight:** Use phrasing that puts the spotlight on them.
  * Instead of “We provide...” say, “You get...”

#### **Step 4: Quick Checklist for Excellent Communication**&#x20;

✅ Is my message clear?\
✅ Am I addressing their problem?\
✅ Have I removed unnecessary jargon?
