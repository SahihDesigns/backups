  Don't be too focused on money, remember, money is not what you actually want,
  it is the means to getting what you want. And success lies in contentment.

### **Understanding the Role of Money**

_Money Is a Result, Not the Goal_

#### &#x20;**Shift the Focus to Value Creation**

* Instead of asking, “How do I make money?” ask, “How do I provide the most value?”
* Focus on _giving_. Money will follow _In shaa Allaah_.

#### &#x20;**The “End of Money” Mindset**

* When you prioritize helping, not earning, you tap into loyalty and repeat customers.
* Example: Resellers don’t just “sell stuff”—they solve problems (like saving time or providing affordable access).

#### &#x20;**Tracking Success Beyond Profits**

* Build testimonials, happy feedback, and relationships—they lead to compound results that money can't buy upfront.
