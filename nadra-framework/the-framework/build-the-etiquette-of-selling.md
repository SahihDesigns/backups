# Build - The Etiquette of Selling

### **Approaching a Customer or Sale (Building Trust and Connection)**

The First Impression: Building Trust, Not Just Transactions. These following sections are designed to be simple and actionable, giving you what you need and eliminating what you don't.

* Your first impression isn’t about selling but showing empathy and understanding. Focus on what the customer values most.

#### **The Psychology of a Sale**

* People don’t buy products—they buy better versions of themselves. Whether it’s a better look, life, or convenience, focus on their aspirations, not just your product.

#### **Hormozi Hook**

* Start with, “What is the dream outcome this customer wants, and how does my product help them get it?”

#### **How to Approach Without Selling**

* Introduce yourself or your product as an answer to something they need.

**Example Scripts:**

* “Hi, I noticed you mentioned struggling with \[problem]. Have you ever tried \[solution]?”
* “I know finding \[specific outcome] is tough — here’s how I might help!”

#### **Common Pitfalls and Fixes**

* **Mistake:** Trying to close/sell too fast.
* **Fix:** Treat every interaction like planting a seed — engage them enough to want to learn more, not feel pressured.

#### **Tools You Can Use Right Now**&#x20;

*   Use a "1-liner formula": Problem → Solution → Result.

    * **Example 1** “I help busy moms save 10 hours a week by automating meal plans.”

    **Look at the problem x solution x results through different lenses**&#x20;

    * **Example 2 (Modesty and Comfort Focused):**\
      &#xNAN;_"I help Muslim women embrace their modesty with confidence by offering hijabs that provide full coverage, comfort, and the perfect fit for all sizes."_
    * **Example 3 (Universal Fit Focused):**\
      &#xNAN;_"I help women of all sizes find their ideal fit by providing high-quality hijabs designed to offer both modesty and comfort without compromise."_
    * **Example 4 (Curated Knitting Supplies):**\
      &#xNAN;_"I help knitters discover new, curated yarns and patterns every month, so they can inspire their creativity and enjoy fresh knitting projects with convenience."_
    * **Example 5 (Gardening):**\
      &#xNAN;_"I help avid gardeners discover top-quality tools and essential gardening accessories each season, so they can cultivate their gardens with ease and satisfaction."_
    * **Example 6 (Abayas for Home):**\
      &#xNAN;_"I help Muslim women feel comfortable at home by offering loose, relaxed abayas designed for everyday wear and ultimate comfort."_
    * **Example 7 (Traditional African Wear for Gatherings):**\
      &#xNAN;_"I help women celebrate culture and modesty with loose, breathable African-inspired wear that's perfect for home or intimate get-togethers with friends and family._
    * **Example 8 (Coaching for Mums):**\
      &#xNAN;_"I help busy moms regain balance in their lives by offering personalized coaching that teaches them how to manage their homes with ease and purpose."_
    * **Example 9 (Homemaker Coaching for Muslim Women):**\
      &#xNAN;_"I help Muslim women embrace their roles as homemakers by providing coaching that empowers them to create organized, loving, and peaceful homes for their families."_

    **Example 10**

    * **For Homemade Snacks Sellers:** _"I help busy families enjoy delicious, affordable homemade snacks that bring comfort and joy to every bite, without the hassle."_
    * **For Cake Bakers:** _"I help celebrate life’s special moments with freshly baked, mouthwatering cakes that are both affordable and unforgettable."_
