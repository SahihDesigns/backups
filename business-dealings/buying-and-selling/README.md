# Buying & Selling

**Buying and Selling in Islaamic Law (Shareeʿah)**

In Islaamic law, buying and selling are governed by strict principles to ensure fairness, mutual consent, and clarity in transactions. To ensure that a sale is valid and accepted, both pillars and conditions must be met:

**1. Pillars (Arkān) of Selling and Buying:**

* **Expression (Al-Ijāb and Al-Qubool):** The buyer’s request and the seller's acceptance must be clear and understood by both parties.
* **Transaction Activity:** The buyer taking the commodity and paying its price, or the reciprocal act, completes the exchange.
* **Presence of Two Parties:** The seller and buyer must be present, though online or via an agent is acceptable.
* **Presence of Items:** The traded item and currency must exist at the time of the transaction.

**2. Conditions (Shurooṭ) of a Correct Transaction:**

* **Eligibility:** Both parties must be mentally sound, adults, free, and aware.
* **Possession:** Both the buyer and seller must own what they are trading; selling what is not owned (e.g., drop-shipping) is prohibited.
* **Transferability:** The seller must be able to hand over the item to the buyer.
* **Lawful Items:** The commodities must be permissible and beneficial, not prohibited or harmful.
* **No Harm:** The seller cannot leave the trade incomplete or with goods that are unsellable.
* **No Time Limit:** The transaction must involve permanent possession, not time-bound agreements.
* **Truthfulness:** There must be no fraud, false description, or misrepresentation of goods.
* **Freedom of Choice:** The transaction must be voluntary, with no coercion or threats involved.
* **Clarity:** The items and the price must be clearly defined to avoid ambiguity.

These pillars and conditions ensure that all transactions comply with Islaamic teachings, emphasizing justice, transparency, and mutual benefit.
