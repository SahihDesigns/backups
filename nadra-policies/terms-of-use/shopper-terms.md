#### **Nadra Buyer Code: Shop Smarter, Respect the Community**

Welcome to Nadra—a place where shopping isn’t just a transaction; it’s an experience rooted in trust, respect, and thoughtfulness. To make every interaction a delightful one, here’s your quick guide to being the best buyer in the community. Let’s grow and thrive together!&#x20;

***

**1. Communicate with Care**

Treat every seller like a trusted business partner. Respectful communication is key. No room for harsh words or negativity here! \
&#xNAN;_&#x57;hy?_ Because kindness and thoughtfulness is what makes our community better. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “**Nothing is heavier upon the scale of a believer on the Day of Resurrection than his good character. Verily, Allah hates the vulgar and obscene.**”
