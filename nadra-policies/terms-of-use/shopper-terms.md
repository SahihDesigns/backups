# Shopper Terms

**Nadra Buyer Code: Shop Smarter, Build Community**\
Welcome to Nadra—a marketplace where shopping isn’t just about transactions but about building trust, respect, and connection. Here’s your guide to being a thoughtful shopper and contributing to our thriving community.

Let’s make every interaction meaningful!

***

#### 1. **Communicate with Care**

Kindness makes everything better. Be polite and respectful in all interactions.

> _“Nothing is heavier on the scale of a believer on the Day of Resurrection than good character.” – **Sunan al-Tirmidhī 2002**_

#### 2. **Check Twice, Deliver Right**

Double-check your details—accurate info means smooth deliveries.

#### 3. **Read Before You Buy**

Take a moment to review product descriptions and seller policies before you hit checkout.\
No surprises = happier you.

#### 4. **Write Honest Reviews**

Your feedback is a significant contribution. It may help to see reviews as a tool to help sellers improve, not as a tool to diminish trust and cause doubts. Keep it fair, honest, and constructive—it matters!

> It is reported that Abī Qilābah (rahimahullāh) said:
>
> > “**If some information reaches you about your brother which you dislike, then search for an excuse for him. And if you do not find an excuse for him, then say: “Maybe he has an excuse which I have no knowledge of.**”
