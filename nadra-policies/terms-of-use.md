# Terms of Use

Weâ€™re excited to have you on board as we work to empower Muslim women by offering a safe, trustworthy, and Islaamically compliant space for buying and selling.

These Terms of Use ("Terms") are the foundation of using our platform. When you sign up to use **Nadra Marketplace Ltd (hereinafter "Nadra")**, you're agreeing to abide by these **standards**, so letâ€™s walk you through themâ€”no confusing jargon here, just plain, simple guidelines, in shaa Allaah!

***

* **Minimum Age**:\
  If you're under the legal age to manage your account on your own, youâ€™ll need permission from a parent or guardian to use our services. Parents and guardians, please note that you are responsible for your child or teen's activities on Nadra.
