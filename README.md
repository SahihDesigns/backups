# The Muslim Woman's Guide to Ethical Business

**What Needs to Change?**

We often get stuck asking the same questions, thinking the same way, and wondering why we don’t get the results we expect. Instead of asking:\
&#xNAN;_“How do I make more sales?”_\
We could Ask: _“What would happen if I focused on the customer’s true needs instead of just pushing products?”_

Instead of asking:\
&#xNAN;_“How do I compete with everyone else?”_\
We could Ask: _“What would it take to make my product so irresistible that customers choose me without hesitation?”_

Instead of asking:\
&#xNAN;_“How do I stand out?”_\
We could Ask: _“What if my approach made every customer feel like they were part of something bigger, something they could trust?”_

As a marketplace, we’re not just asking, _“How do we build a better platform?”_\
Instead, we’re asking: _“What needs to change for ethical business to become the norm, not the exception?”_ Let's challenge ourselves to ask the right questions—ones that help us solve problems, grow with purpose, and create a real impact. It's time to rethink the way we build, sell, and serve.

Learn. Strengthen. Ask. Give. <mark style="color:red;">**|**</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">Learn More</mark>](nadra-framework/the-framework/)
