# Nadra Marketplace Ethics & Halaal Business Guide | Sell with Integrity & Barakah

### **A Guide to Ethical & Profitable Business for Muslim Women**

Business is more than just transactions — it’s trust, purpose, and responsibility. At Nadra, we believe that success should come with barakah, built on principles that align with our faith.

This page is for **Muslim women entrepreneurs** who want to:

* **Sell ethically** and run a business that is both profitable and halaal.
* **Understand Islaamic business ethics** and how to apply them in modern commerce.
* **Shift the culture** — so ethical selling isn’t the exception, but the standard.

We haven’t launched our marketplace yet. But before we trade goods, we’re setting the foundation for something bigger: **a space where Muslim women do business with thoughtfulness, clarity, and confidence.**

***

#### **Why This Matters**

Too often, business is shaped by pressure to compete at any cost. Sellers underprice their work, overpromise, or struggle to stand out. Buyers hesitate, unsure who to trust. **What if we built something different?**

* **A marketplace rooted in ethics -** where business is an act of ibaadah.
* **A shift in mindset -** where sellers know their worth and buyers value quality.
* **A commitment to trust -** where every transaction is transparent and fair. _(in shaa Allaah)_

**We’re building this together. It starts here.**

#### **A New Culture of Business Starts With Us**

The way we sell shapes the way we buy. The way we buy shapes the kind of businesses that thrive. **If we want to see change, we have to be that change&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**|**</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">**Learn more**</mark>](transformational-sales/the-price-of-undervaluing-ourselves-how-we-teach-people-to-treat-us.md)

This isn’t only about one marketplace- it’s about setting a new standard for how Muslim women do business. A standard that values honesty over hype, quality over quick wins, and barakah over shortcuts.

We’re not here to sell you anything today. We’re here to **build something that lasts.**
