# Nadra Marketplace Ethics & Halaal Business Guide | Sell with Integrity & Barakah

### **A Guide to Ethical & Profitable Business for Muslim Women**

Business is more than just transactions — it’s trust, purpose, and responsibility. Your business should be more than just sales — it should be a source of barakah, confidence, and trust. Imagine running a business where every transaction strengthens your faith and your income _in shaa Allaah._

This page is for **Muslim women entrepreneurs** who want to:

* **Sell ethically** and run a business that is both profitable and halaal.
* **Understand Islaamic business ethics** and how to apply them in modern commerce.
* **Shift the culture** — so ethical selling isn’t the exception, but the standard.

We haven’t launched our marketplace yet. But before we trade goods, we’re setting the foundation for something bigger: **a space where Muslim women do business with thoughtfulness, clarity, and confidence.**

***

#### **Why This Matters**

Ever felt pressured to lower your prices, overpromise, or struggle to stand out? Have you hesitated before buying, unsure who to trust? You’re not alone. But what if you could run a business where trust, meaningful relationships and barakah were at the center?

* **A marketplace rooted in ethics -** where business is an act of ibaadah.
* **A shift in mindset -** where sellers know their worth and buyers value quality.
* **A commitment to trust -** where every transaction is transparent and fair. _(in shaa Allaah)_

**We’re building this together. It starts here.**

#### **A New Culture of Business Starts With Us**

The way we sell shapes the way we buy. The way we buy shapes the kind of businesses that thrive. **If we want to see change, we have to be that change&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**|**</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">**Learn more**</mark>](transformational-sales/the-price-of-undervaluing-ourselves-how-we-teach-people-to-treat-us.md)
