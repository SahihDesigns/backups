# The Price of Undervaluing Ourselves: How We Teach People to Treat Us

### <mark style="color:red;">A Disclaimer on Balance</mark>

While it is crucial to uphold fair pricing and value our work, we must also be cautious not to shift to another extreme. Islaam encourages kindness and generosity, as Allaah says, _“And do not forget kindness amongst yourselves.”_ (Qur'an 2:237) The Prophet (ﷺ) also said, _“Have mercy on those on earth, and the Most Merciful will have mercy on you.”_ (Tirmidhi)

Helping others through reasonable pricing, supporting those in need, and making ethical decisions in business are all commendable actions. The goal is not to eliminate generosity, but to ensure it is practiced with wisdom, sustainability, and fairness. Pricing should not be so low that it devalues labor and effort, nor should it be so rigid that it removes opportunities to help others. Striking a balance between fairness and kindness is what leads to true barakah in business in shaa Allaah and Allaah knows best.

### The Price of Undervaluing Ourselves: How We Teach People to Treat Us

The way we price our work reflects our self-worth. It influences how others engage with us, sets expectations, and defines the kind of marketplace we create.

When a seller lowers their price just to close a deal, they imply their product or service wasn’t worth the original amount. When businesses compete on price rather than quality, they reinforce the idea that cheaper is always better. And when buyers push for excessive discounts, they shape an economy where the lowest bid wins, not the best offering.

This isn’t just business — it’s the culture we cultivate with every transaction.

### How We Sell Shapes How People Buy

Sellers establish the standard. When businesses operate with integrity, deliver quality, and stand firm in their pricing, buyers respect that. But if sellers undervalue their work, overpromise, or price out of fear, buyers respond with skepticism. They wait for discounts, question legitimacy, and stop trusting that fair pricing exists. Shift your mindset from [<mark style="color:purple;">scarcity to abundance.</mark>](sales-back-to-the-basics/abundance-over-scarcity.md) Shift it from believing the only value you offer is low pricing.

If a business constantly runs sales, customers hesitate to buy at full price. If sellers routinely offer discounts, people stop believing in the original price altogether. And if we don’t stand by our worth, why should anyone else?

Lowering prices might seem like a way to make products accessible, and indeed, helping others through fair pricing is commendable. But accessibility isn’t only about affordability — it’s about sustainability. A model that works today but collapses tomorrow is a failing strategy. True accessibility means pricing fairly so businesses can thrive and continue serving their customers long-term.

### How We Buy Shapes the Businesses That Survive

What we invest in grows. When buyers choose ethical businesses, respect fair pricing, and avoid chasing the lowest possible cost, they create a space where quality businesses can flourish. But if the only concern is “How cheap can I get this?” it rewards companies that cut corners, exploit workers, and compromise on quality.

Ethical businesses struggle while mass-market, low-cost goods flood the market. Artisans can’t compete with factories. Many skilled women undercharge until they burn out. The marketplace reflects what people value — if we want better, we have to choose better.

A barakah-driven economy isn’t just about profit. It’s about trust, sustainability, and ensuring the long-term well-being of all involved. Every purchase is a vote for the kind of marketplace we want to exist.

### If We Want Change, We Have to Lead It

Pricing isn’t just a financial decision — it’s about sustainability, dignity, and barakah. As Muslim women entrepreneurs, we must see fair pricing as an obligation, not an option. It’s a responsibility to ourselves and our communities.

If we don’t want businesses that underpay workers, we can’t support them. If we value craftsmanship, we must stop expecting handmade goods at factory prices. If we want a marketplace that serves us, we must set the standard instead of letting the market dictate our worth.

Better sellers create better buyers. Better buyers create stronger businesses. The cycle begins with us.

This isn’t about inflating prices — it’s about setting them right. Because the cost of undervaluing ourselves is far greater than we realize.
