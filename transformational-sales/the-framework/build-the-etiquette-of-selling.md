# Build - The Etiquette of Selling

### **Approaching a Customer or Sale (Building Trust and Connection)**

* Your first impression isn’t about selling but showing empathy and understanding. Focus on what the customer values most.

#### **The Psychology of a Sale**

* People don’t buy products—they buy better versions of themselves. Whether it’s a better look, life, or convenience, focus on their aspirations, not just your product.

#### **Hormozi Hook**

* Start with, “What is the dream outcome this customer wants, and how does my product help them get it?”

#### **How to Approach Without Selling**

* Introduce yourself or your product as an answer to something they need.

**Example Scripts:**

* “Hi, I noticed you mentioned struggling with \[problem]. Have you ever tried \[solution]?”
* “I know finding \[specific outcome] is tough — here’s how I might help!”

#### **Common Pitfalls and Fixes**

* **Mistake:** Trying to close/sell too fast.
* **Fix:** Treat every interaction like planting a seed — engage them enough to want to learn more, not feel pressured.

#### **Tools You Can Use Right Now**

* Use a "1-liner formula": Problem → Solution → Result.
  * **E.g.:** “I help busy moms save 10 hours a week by automating meal plans.”
