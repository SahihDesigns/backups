# Strengthen - Patience

### **Turning “Not Now” into “Let’s Talk!”**

#### **Step 1: Understanding Patience in Business**

* Great sales come from trust, and trust is built over time.

#### **Step 2: How to Follow Up**

* Set a system for follow-ups (use a simple tracker or CRM).
*   **Scripts:**

    * “I wanted to check back on \[conversation topic]. Have your thoughts changed about \[their need]?”
    * “Hey, just a reminder—this could help you solve \[problem] when you're ready.”

    **A customer inquired but didn't buy - Circle back after a while**

    * “Are you still interested in \[insert what they inquired about / service you offer]?”

#### **Step 3: Timing Is Key**

* Use the "Buying Window" approach (Dean Jackson): Most customers don’t need you now, but when they do, they should remember you first.
* Keep offering value through helpful messages or resources, even if they’re not buying yet.
