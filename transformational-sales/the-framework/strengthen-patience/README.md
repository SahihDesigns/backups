# Strengthen - Patience

### **Turning “Not Now” into “Let’s Talk!”**

#### **Step 1: Understanding Patience in Business**

* Great sales come from trust, and trust is built over time.

#### **Step 2: How to Follow Up**

* Set a system for follow-ups (use a simple tracker or CRM).
*   **Scripts:**

    * “I wanted to check back on \[conversation topic]. Have your thoughts changed about \[their need]?”
    * “Hey, just a reminder—this could help you solve \[problem] when you're ready.”

    **A customer inquired but didn't buy - Circle back after a while**

    * “Are you still interested in \[insert what they inquired about / service you offer]?”
    * **Why Follow-ups Matter:**\
      Follow-ups are important because they help you stay connected with your customers or leads after an initial contact, making sure you're building relationships and not losing touch.
    * **What is a Simple Tracker or CRM?**
      * **Simple Tracker:** It can be something as simple as a spreadsheet or a checklist that you use to keep track of who you need to follow up with and when. For example, a list where you write down the name, date of the first contact, and date to follow up.
      * **CRM (Customer Relationship Management):** It's a tool (software) that keeps track of all interactions you have with customers. It’s more organized, and it can help remind you when and how to follow up. Some popular CRM tools include HubSpot, Zoho, and even Excel.
    * **How to Use It:**
      * Create a list of everyone you need to follow up with (whether customers who made an inquiry or leads who haven't bought yet).
      * Set a reminder or specific time frame when you plan to check back in with them (this can be one week, one month, or based on what works for you).
      * Use a tracker or CRM tool to remind you and update the list every time you successfully follow up.
    * **Why It's Useful:** A system will make sure you don’t forget to reach out to your clients or leads. By staying organized and consistent, you're more likely to close sales and build long-term relationships in shaa Allaah.

#### **Step 3: Timing Is Key**

* Use the "Buying Window" approach (Dean Jackson): Most customers don’t need you now, but when they do, they should remember you first.
* Keep offering value through helpful messages or resources, even if they’re not buying yet.
