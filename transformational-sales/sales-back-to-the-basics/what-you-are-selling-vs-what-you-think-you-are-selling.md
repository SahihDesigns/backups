# What you are Selling vs What you Think you are Selling

In the world of sales, understanding what your customer truly values is the key to offering products that resonate with them. Often, sellers focus on what they think they are selling — the physical product or service — without considering the deeper, sometimes intangible needs that drive customer decisions.

**A Missed Opportunity: The Nokia Example**

Consider Nokia, once the undisputed leader in the mobile phone industry. At its peak, Nokia dominated the mobile market with devices that were known for their durability and reliability. However, they failed to anticipate the shifting needs of their consumers.

When Apple released the iPhone, Nokia and others in the industry dismissed it, believing the device was too expensive and that people wouldn’t want to trade their traditional phones for a device with a touchscreen and no keyboard. This mindset was rooted in a focus on **hardware** over the **emotional needs** of the consumer. In short, they were focused on selling phones but failed to understand the deeper value of what a phone could represent for their users.

An influential example of this is shared by **Jan Chipchase**, a Nokia researcher, in his TED Talk, "The Anthropology of Mobile Phones." He tells the story of an anthropologist working in a refugee camp. Despite having little to their names, the refugees were willing to trade valuable possessions for access to a smartphone. This anecdote underscores the **emotional value** that smartphones had for people — it wasn’t about just making calls or sending texts, it was about staying connected, feeling less isolated, and having access to a broader world of information.

The mistake Nokia made was thinking they were just selling **mobile phones**. What they were actually selling was **connection, empowerment, and social status** — something far more valuable than hardware features alone. <mark style="color:red;">**|**</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">Learn More</mark>](https://www.ted.com/talks/jan_chipchase_the_anthropology_of_mobile_phones/details)

**The Car Buyer Analogy: Understanding Customer Motivation**

Let’s apply this idea to a common sales scenario: someone walks into a car dealership looking to buy a new car. On the surface, it seems like they’re just in the market for a vehicle. You might be tempted to show them a range of cars based purely on their specifications, price, and features. However, this would be a mistake if you don’t first take the time to **understand&#x20;**_**why**_ they need a car in the first place.

Imagine you ask them some key questions:

* "Why do you need a new car?"
* "What are you hoping the car will do for you?"
* "What’s wrong with your current car?"

In the course of the conversation, you learn that their old car makes them feel embarrassed when they park it in a lot filled with their colleagues' newer, more expensive cars. However, they also have a strict budget. This person isn't simply looking to buy a car — they’re looking for **status**, **social validation**, and **embarrassment protection**. They want to project a sense of success without breaking the bank.

The car isn’t just a vehicle; it's a **status symbol**, a tool for managing perceptions, and an emotional purchase. If you sell them the wrong car — one that doesn’t meet these deeper needs — you risk missing the sale. Instead of pushing a car because it's affordable or practical, you should be focusing on the **emotional and social benefits** the car provides.

**What Sellers Need to Understand: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Wishful Thinking**

This is where many sellers go wrong. They fall into the trap of wishful thinking: they assume the product is enough on its own. They mistakenly believe that selling shoes, bags, or hijabs is simply about the item itself — its color, style, or functionality. But in reality, you're not just selling those items. You’re selling **confidence**, **self-expression**, **status**, or even **freedom**.

Let’s say you’re selling a hijaab. It’s not just a piece of cloth. For us Muslim women, it’s about **modesty**, hayaa (shyness) and something deeper than simply a piece of fabric.&#x20;

> Allaah jala wa ala said
>
> O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful
>
> — Al-Hilali & Khan Qur'aan 33:59

So, if you sell it purely based on its fabric or pattern, you're missing the **deeper value** your customer seeks. Similarly, a handbag may not just be a container for personal belongings — it can be a symbol of success, sophistication, and taste.

Sellers who focus solely on **features** miss the bigger picture. By not understanding **why** a customer wants something, you're likely to miss the mark.  Sell the benefit, transformation and results, not the features.

#### Key Takeaways:

1. **Ask the Right Questions**: Understand what the customer truly values before offering a solution. Don’t just _assume their needs_ are obvious.
2. **Dig Deeper**: Just as Nokia missed the mark by focusing too much on hardware, you should focus on the **emotional** and **social** needs your product _fulfills._
3. **Listen and be attentive**: Truly listen to what your customers are saying — the answers are often not in what they explicitly say, but in what they don't and other times in actually what they **do**.&#x20;

**Example:** I once asked a group of sellers if they’d be interested in splitting a group I co-admin — into a "Seller Support" section and another for buyer inquiries. The poll showed interest, but when the group was set up, no one used it. Why? Because while they liked the idea, they weren’t fully aware of what actually motivated their actions. So, in this way, customers often don’t realize the deeper factors driving their decisions, and when you ask them to step outside their usual habits, it can lead to a lack of participation. Asking clear [open-ended questions](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] can uncover more insights than you would expect.

4. **Embrace the Power of Connection**: Whether it’s a car, a phone, or a hijaab, your customer is seeking something more than just the physical product. They’re after a deeper **connection**, **status**, or **validation**.

By recognizing the **real reasons** people buy, you can position your products as the solution to **underlying emotional needs**, which is the ultimate key to transformational sales _In shaa Allaah._

[^1]: An open-ended question is one that encourages a detailed or thoughtful response, rather than a simple "yes" or "no" answer. These questions typically begin with words like "how," "why," "what," or "describe," and they invite the person to elaborate on their thoughts, feelings, or experiences.

    For example:

    * "What motivated you to choose this product?"
    * "How do you envision using this service?"
    * "Why do you think this change could benefit you?"

    Open-ended questions help to gather more information and insights by allowing the respondent to share more freely.
