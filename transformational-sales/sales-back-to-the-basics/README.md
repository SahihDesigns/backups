# Sales: Back to the Basics

> Imām ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Nāṣir al-Saʿdī may Allāh have mercy on him said that scholars differ on the best occupation, with some favoring farming, trade, or craftsmanship. However, the most beneficial occupation is that which serves humanity the most, as stated in the ḥadīth: "Aspire and strive towards that which is beneficial to you and seek Allāh’s aid (and do not feel helpless)."

In the bustling streets of West Africa where I grew up, business wasn't just business - it was survival. Every sale felt like a desperate push against rejection, every pitch a forceful intrusion into uninterested lives. This relentless game of survival painted such a distasteful picture of entrepreneurship that I found myself recoiling from it entirely. Like many others, I had been sold a version of business that left nothing but discomfort in its wake.&#x20;

Let me break down the four types of business owners I observed in my community - it's like a cast of characters that shaped my understanding of commerce:

First, we had the Market Listeners - think of them as the good detectives of business. They actually paid attention to what people needed and wanted. They were the ones running stores that stocked fresh groceries, household essentials, and daily necessities. They understood **part** of the basics of business, which is solving real problems for real people.

Then there were the Wishful Thinkers - imagine someone opening a high-end designer boutique in a small farming town. They were so focused on what they personally wanted to sell that they forgot to ask, "Does anyone around here actually want or need this?" They were basically having a conversation with themselves rather than their customers.&#x20;

The Warriors were the pushy salespeople that exist in every culture - from the persistent street vendors in Lagos who'll follow you for blocks insisting you need their watches or bags "aunty come and buy," to the hovering electronics store salesperson in Dubai who won't let you browse in peace, to that American car dealership agent who tracks you around the lot like a shadow. Think of the fabric sellers in Accra's Makola Market who'll literally grab your arm.

These sellers treated commerce like warfare, where every customer was a target to be worn down. The really concerning part? Many didn't even believe in their products. They'd pressure someone into buying that knockoff designer bag "this is original, check am na", or that questionable used car, using the same tactics worldwide: fake scarcity ("Last one in stock!"), guilt trips ("This thing will suit you well"), and relentless pursuit. Their aggressive energy was universal and exhausting. These were the sellers who made shopping feel like surviving an ambush, leaving customers feeling relieved when they escaped, rather than satisfied with their purchase.

Finally, we had the Safe Players. Think of them as the cover bands of the business world - they stuck to selling familiar products in familiar ways. While this wasn't necessarily bad (after all, people do need reliable places to buy everyday items), they missed opportunities to innovate or stand out.

Business or Sales isn't about forcing your desires on others or playing it too safe - it's about finding that sweet spot where what you offer meets what people actually need or want. _**Pay attention**._&#x20;

## **Cultural Shift in Selling: Moving Beyond Mindset to Transform Your Approach**

### 1. Cultural Shift: From Selling to Delivering Value

Many entrepreneurs focus on selling their product, but the real shift happens when you move from selling to delivering Value. This is not just a mindset change; it’s a cultural shift in how you approach your business.

* **Understand Your Offer & Its Impact**: Your product or service isn’t just something to sell; it’s something that solves a problem, meets a need, or fulfills a desire. Ask yourself:
  * What do I offer that is of real value?
  * Who benefits from my offer?
  * How does my offer make a difference?
* **Find the Sweet Spot**: The perfect offer sits at the intersection of:
  * What you can give (your product or service)
  * What you desire (your business goals and purpose)
  * What others want (your target audience’s needs and challenges)
* **Get Sold on Your Own Product**: "To the extent that you are sold, you will sell" - Grant. If you’re not convinced your product will change lives, help people, or solve real problems, you may need to re-evaluate what you’re selling. A strong belief in your offer fuels authentic sales.
* **Position Yourself as an Expert**: If you already have the expertise, own it. If not, invest in learning and improving so that you can confidently deliver value. We often stay stuck in familiar ways, resisting growth, yet expect better sales outcomes. So invest in yourself. "The biggest and best investment that you can make is in your own skillset. Because skills are the ultimate hedge against inflation. They are the hedge against currency changes. People say: 'what's going to happen to the dollar?' It doesn't matter, if you have value to exchange, the world will exchange for it." - Alex hormozi.

**Actionable Exercise:**

1. **Write down your product/service and the problem it solves.**
   * Example: If you sell handmade skincare products, the problem might be that many store-bought options contain harmful chemicals, and people need safer, natural alternatives.
2. **List three real-life examples of people who could benefit from it.**
   * Example:
     * A mother looking for chemical-free products for her children.
     * A person with sensitive skin who reacts badly to store-bought creams.
     * A health-conscious buyer who wants to support sustainable brands.
3. **Imagine you are your customer - what would convince you to buy it?**
   * Step into their shoes:
     * What would make you trust this product?
     * What emotions or desires drive your decision?
     * Would a personal story, a demonstration, or a guarantee make you feel more confident in your purchase?
4. **Identify one way you can improve your offer to better serve your audience.**
   * Example: If you notice that your customers care about sustainability, you might introduce **eco-friendly packaging** or a **refillable option**.
   * If people hesitate due to price, could you offer a **trial size** to build trust before they commit to a full-size purchase?

**Challenge:** Ask five potential customers what would make them more confident in purchasing your product. Compare their answers to your own. What insights did you gain?
